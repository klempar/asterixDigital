# Asterix Digital — Headless Core

This workspace contains an initial scaffold for the headless game engine (`Asterix.Core`), a CLI runner (`Asterix.CLI`), reference bots (`Asterix.Bots`) and a test project. The core is intentionally minimal and ready to be extended with immutable state, rules implementation, deterministic RNG, and replay logging.
